## Description
Windows C# application with main goal of assisting you during Hextech crafting! The application will fetch data from the running client, mirroring your Hextech data. It will allow you to do much more and much faster!

## Functionality
- Display your current loot (champion, skin, emote, ward, icon and chest type).

- Disenchanting or upgrading multiple shards at once with 1 click!

- Bulk opening/crafting/forging/exchanging chests and tokens!

Every run the app will send request to `https://api.github.com/repos/MaciejGorczyca/HextechButBetter/releases/latest` and check latest release date then print it in app.

## No more annoying animations or monotous repetition!
- Disenchant all your champions by selecting them in app. Select disenchanting and click process. Let the magic do the work for you!

- Open 100 or 1000 chests at once! It takes a while for the server to process the data but you won't get annoyed by animations and you will save yourself 5 minutes and mental pain of crafting the normal way...

- Exchange 1000 tokens for 100 key fragments instantly by typing how many times you want the process to repeat itself!
